As specified in the commitments, "risk assessments should consider model capabilities and the context in which they are developed and deployed, as well as the efficacy of implemented mitigations." This requires: (1) evaluation of model capabilities, (2) consideration of development and deployment context, (3) assessment of mitigation efficacy, and (4) incorporation of both internal and external evaluations.'

The commitments specify that "these thresholds should be defined with input from trusted actors and be accompanied by an explanation of how thresholds were decided upon." Requirements include: (1) clear threshold definitions, (2) monitoring procedures, (3) documentation of threshold determination, and (4) specific examples of intolerable risk scenarios.'

The commitments state that "in the extreme, organisations commit not to develop or deploy a model or system at all, if mitigations cannot be applied to keep risks below the thresholds." This requires: (1) risk response procedures, (2) deployment criteria, and (3) conditions for complete halting.'

The five categories below correspond directly to the five components of Outcome 1 as described in the commitment document. These commitments represent public promises made by leading AI companies to world governments and the global community, establishing expectations for transparency and responsible development of frontier AI systems.
